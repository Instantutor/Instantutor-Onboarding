## Git and Github

To start with you are going to need to be able to know how to use git. To do this first start by making sure you have git downloaded. You can do this by typing the following command into the terminal:

```
git --version
```

This should tell you what version of git you currently have installed. If you do not have git installed you can download it from **[here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**. Coming packaged with this bundle is the git bash, a very useful terminal with linux like functionality and other features that allow you to work easily with git.

With git installed do the following:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Instantutor/Instantutor-Onboarding.git`
2. Create your own branch using `git branch YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`
3. Checkout to that branch using `git checkout YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`
4. Make a change to the document by adding your username to the list of usernames below
5. Add your changes to the index using `git add *`
6. Commit your changes using `git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_TITLE" -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE`
7. Push your code to Github using `git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`
    1. You are doing this cause you've created a new branch but generally you can remove the -u argument and make it `git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME`
8. Create a pull request
